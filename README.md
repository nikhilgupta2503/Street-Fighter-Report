# Street-Fighter-Report


🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I’ve recently completed a fun and engaging project inspired by a fantastic YouTube tutorial! 🎮✨

The project is a Street Fighter Game Report created using Power BI. It features interactive visuals with images and brief descriptions of various Street Fighter characters. With advanced slicers, you can easily explore and get detailed insights into your favorite fighters.

Although this report is more for fun than business analysis, I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
